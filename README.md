# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the relationships between the success of theater capaigns relative to their launch date and the effect funding goals have on the success of plays using the data provided in our Kickstarter speadsheet. This will give our client the information she needs to decide when to launch her campaign and which goals to aim for.
### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To come to our conclusion on launch date, we created a pivot table using the success, failed and canceled data set along with the launch date months. To better visualize these outcomes we plotted this on a pivot line graph.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In order to analyze the outcomes based on goals we used the percentage successful, failed and canceled data set along with the montetary goals for each play. Once we built a pivot table using these data sets, we created a pivot graph to better visualize the data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on our analysis, we can see that the majority of successful campaigns occured during the months of April, May, June, July and August. This seems to be the most popular time of the year for theater productions to premiere. I would recommend our client aim for a premiere date during this time. We can also see that October and December both have a high fail rate compared to other months by seeing how close the successful and failed points are merging on the line graph. I would recommend our client avoid premiering her theater production during these months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on our analysis, we can see that the the chance the play will fail positively correlates with the goal amount except in the range of $30,000-$44,999. Based on these results I would recommend our client either keep her goal below $4,999 or have her goal in the range of $35,000-$44,999. This will give her the greatest chance of success according to the data we were asked to analyze. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The Outcomes based on Launch Date dataset can be misleading. Even though we can see the number of successful and failed campaigns on the graph, it would be more accurate to see the percentage of success and failed campaigns to be more accurate rather than eyeballing the differences on the graph. Also, we also don't know the quality of the productions that could lead to them either failing or succeeding. If we could see the reviews and ratings of the productions we could see if that was a contributing factor rather than the time of launch. 

- For the Outcomes Based on Goals dataset, we don't have that many plays that had goals above $15,000, so our conclusions on the outcomes for this range might not be significant. Also, similar to the Outcomes Based on Launch Date, we don't know the quality of the plays that succeeded and failed. So, other variables could have more impact on the success of these plays. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For plays and theater productions, I would suggest we look at the average ratings for the succeeded and failed plays to see if the plot of the play or perhaps the quality of the performance had more to do with the rate of success. Also, we could look at the themes of each production to see if there are certain trends that perform better at the box office. We can also look deeper at the success and failure rate of productions by month by seeing what other similar options are available during that time of the year that people are spending their disposable income on.
